Astral Project - Aura and Karma Decision System
Astral is a dynamic creative platform designed to foster collaboration and innovation by aligning creativity (aura) with social proof (karma). This system uses a recursive decision-making model to help teams, creatives, and individuals refine their ideas through an AI-generated tournament of decisions, which ultimately compresses concepts into a tangible, visual format.

Overview
Astral's decision-making system revolves around a central concept:
test
Aura represents the quality and intrinsic creativity of an idea.
Karma reflects the social proof or validation an idea has earned through community interaction.
In this project, a visual field of ideas is created, where each idea (point) is connected to a central node. The closer a point is to the center, the more impactful it is—determined by its aura and karma.

Core Features
Field of Ideas
Visual Representation: Ideas are displayed as points in a circular field. Each point's distance from the center reflects its aura and karma:
Outer Rim: Less impactful ideas with lower aura and karma.
Inner Area: Highly impactful ideas with higher aura and karma.
Path to Center: Each idea is connected to the center with a path, representing its potential for refinement and integration into the core concept.
Recursive Decision-Making
2x2 Prisoner's Dilemma: The decision-making process is modeled after the prisoner’s dilemma, where ideas are pitted against one another in an AI-generated tournament.
AI-Generated States: Game states are generated by AI, dynamically creating challenges and dilemmas that players or teams must navigate to progress through the game.
Tournament of Ideas: Ideas undergo a rule-based process of elimination, culminating in a decision matrix that visually shows the evolution and impact of ideas over time.
Aura and Karma
Aura: Represents the creative quality of an idea. Ideas with higher aura are closer to the center.
Karma: Reflects the social validation an idea receives. Higher karma pushes ideas toward the center, improving their visibility and impact.
Dynamic Interaction: Players, teams, and AI can influence both aura and karma, making the decision-making process fluid and adaptable.
How It Works
Generate Points: The system generates a collection of points, each representing an idea with specific values for aura and karma.
Visualize Field: These points are visualized in a radial layout where the impact (combination of aura and karma) determines their position relative to the center.
Player Interaction: Users select paths and engage in decision-making processes, using AI-generated dilemmas based on a 1v1 matrix.
Real-Time Updates: As decisions are made, the field updates to reflect the progression and impact of each idea.
Game States: AI dynamically generates new game states and dilemmas, keeping the experience engaging and unpredictable.
