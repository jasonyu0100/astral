            Why We Built Astral
          </h2>
          <p className='text-lg text-gray-300'>
            We understand that traditional project management tools can feel

            Astral—a platform designed to work the way you do. With a focus on
            conversational visual mapping, real-time idea synthesis, and
            automated workflow management, Astral adapts to the unique needs of
            creative professionals, allowing ideas to flow naturally.
