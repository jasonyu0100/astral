Astral enters a $6.59B project management market alongside competitors like Miro, ChatGPT, Milanote, and Slack, blending the best features of conversation and visual whiteboarding into one powerful tool. Unlike other platforms, Astral focuses on AI-driven, conversation-first workflows that help creatives move faster and more effectively.
