DRAFT TWO

Four Quadrant Space Game (TBD Dual Game)

Players PA and PB have access to pieces with different colours (i.e. pieces)
Colours exert influence on others but are static in normal conditions
Colours have a positive or negative charge (+) or (-)
They can be launched vertically or horizontally 
Opposing pieces have destructive interference
Similar pieces can phase cause a change in direction
They are confined to a quadrant


<- ->

Special Yin / Yang pieces can be gained that can change a region of space into rotation
Yin Yang pieces act as pivot points with a lifespan that decays over time
The Yin piece has anti-clockwise rotation and is owned by PA who has (+) pieeces
The Yang piece has clockwise rotation and is owned by PB who has (-) pieces
They can cancel each other out if occupying a same field of influence

NOTE
Diamond Rotation
Clockwise = TR BR BL TL
Anti-clockwise = TL BR TR BL

These special pieces are gained by converting groups of pieces
They can be used as offensive or defensive tools
Scattering opposing pieces
Putting complementary pieces in orbit
